# Smart Retention – Predicting Customer Churn with AI

---

## 📊 Customer Retention Report

### **Project Objective:**

1. Build a machine learning model to predict customer churn.  
2. Apply **feature transformation** and **data preprocessing** to improve prediction accuracy.

### **Purpose of Customer Retention System:**  
Help businesses identify customers likely to churn and take proactive actions to improve loyalty and retention.

### **Importance of Feature Transformation:**  
Enhance model performance through data scaling, encoding, and optimization — ensuring accurate churn predictions based on customer behavior patterns.

### **Role of the Application:**  
Analyze structured data, perform transformations, and use AI models to classify customers into "churn" or "retain" categories for data-driven business insights.
